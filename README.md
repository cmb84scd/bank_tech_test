# Tech tests

In this repo you'll find all the tech tests I have done. Each will be in their own folder and the folder name will include which tech is used eg `bank_ruby` is a bank tech test in Ruby. Each folder will have it's own README with all the necessary info for that tech test.

I have done this as I realised that I will be doing a few and decided that rather than have them scattered over my github, I would have them all in one repo to make them easier to find.
